# The 6 Ws of Testing

* A Guided Panel of One

## Be Objective

* Like a good reporter
* I will fail
* Opinions are subjective
* Ignore Me!

## Google results

* Testing: 251m
* Testing Code: 94m
* Testing Programming: 37m
* Testing Ruby: 7m
* M-W Dictionary: A means for evaluation
* F-U Dictionary

## Philosophical

* There are other "tips and tricks" talks
* There are tons of blog posts of examples
* You are smart, you can read the docs

## The Ws

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws
* Who (dr who)
* Why (family guy philosopher) 
* When (back to the future delorean)
* Where (in the world is carmen san diego)
* What (what 'chu talkin' bout willis?)
* How (the way things work)

## Who

* The QA guys (asok)
* The client (ted)
* The manager (phb)
* The smartest guy (dilbert)
* The dumbest guy (wally)
* Everyone
* No-one
* You

## Why

* Quailty
* The client says so
* My boss says so
* My psychic says so
* To save time (testing payoff curve)
  * Five months from now, do you know *why* you wrote it like that or why it works like that?
  ( snippet of some ruby golf - maybe from a programming challenge w/ test suite)
* To write what you need? (test-first, TDD)
* To sleep at night?

## When

* When the problem is difficult
* When you don't know what you want to do
* When you know what you want to do
* At the end
* In the beginning
* All of the time
* Most of the time
* What is the payoff
* how much is worth it?

## Where

* The QA department
* India
* Side by side
* In the code

* Bottom level
* Mid Level
* High Level
* Every level

## What

* The libraries we use
* Our internal code
* External-facing (end-user) code

* How it behaves (overparenting)
* Five year old buys a candy bar
* Your friend buys a candy bar
* A stranger buys a candy bar
* (A stranger buys *you* a candy bar?)
* What do we care about
* Input => Work => Results
* Black box
* Overkill?


## How

* Ask your code a question
* Check the answer
* Asking a good question is important
* Code.awesome? => true => Done!
* Ask a simple question (too simple?)
* Ask a complicated question (too complicated?)
* Ask an appropriate question
  When I register on the site
  Then 
    * there should be 47 users
    * there should be one more user
    * I can log in

* Don't ask redundant questions
  * http://mocha.rubyforge.org/examples/mocha.html
  * line(5) == "warp_factor.times { @dilithium.nuke(:anti_matter) }"

* Write what you want to say (your tests are your docs)

* Trust
* How much do you trust the code?
* Trust other tests


* stick to the level
* don't ask low level questions during a high level test
* don't ask high level questions during a low level test

## So many opinions

* no one knows
* what is the most cost-effective?
* the most productive
* If we knew, this would have been very boring
* Always ask questions
* There are no pure answers
