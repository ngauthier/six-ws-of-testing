# The 6 Ws of Testing

## My Goal: Be Objective

* Like a good reporter
* I will fail
* Opinions are subjective
* Ignore Me!

## Google results

* Testing: 251m
* Testing Code: 94m
* Testing Programming: 37m
* Testing Ruby: 7m
* M-W Dictionary: A means for evaluation
* F-U Dictionary

## Philosophical

* There are other "tips and tricks" talks
* There are tons of blog posts of examples
* You are smart
* I have points to prompt discussion
* Interrupt me!
* Seriously, right now, while I read this slide to you. Do it.
* Wise guy

## The 6 Ws

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws
* Why (family guy philosopher) 
* Who (dr who)
* When (back to the future delorean)
* Where (in the world is carmen san diego)
* What (what 'chu talkin' bout willis?)
* How (the way things work)

## Why

* Quailty
* Client says so
* Boss says so
* Psychic says so
* To save time (testing payoff curve)
  * Five months from now, do you know *why* you wrote it like that or why it works like that?
  ( snippet of some ruby golf - maybe from a programming challenge w/ test suite)
* To write what you need? (test-first, TDD)
* To sleep at night?

* Ask: Why do you want to test? (Why are you here?)

## Who

* The QA guys (asok)
* The client (ted)
* The manager (phb)
* The smartest guy (dilbert)
* The dumbest guy (wally)
* Everyone
* No-one
* You

* Ask: Who should test (discuss)

## When

* When the problem is difficult
* When the problem is easy
* When you don't know what to do
* When you do know what to do
* At the end
* In the beginning
* All of the time
* Most of the time
* What is the payoff
* How much is worth it?

## Where

* ... in the world
* The QA department
* India
* Side by side
* In the code

* ... in the code
* Bottom level
* Mid Level
* High Level
* Every level

## What

* A tree data structure?
* A sorting algorithm?
* Your DB queries?
* The html you generate?
* AJAX Calls?
* Javascript you wrote?
* CSS rollovers?

* How it behaves (overparenting)
* Five year old buys a candy bar
* Your friend buys a candy bar
* A stranger buys a candy bar
* (A stranger buys *you* a candy bar?)
* What do we care about
* Input => Work => Results
* Black box

## How

* Ask your code a question
* Check the answer
* Asking a good question is important
* Code.awesome? => true => Done!
* Ask a simple question (too simple?)
    * Example
* Ask a complicated question (too complicated?)
    * Example
* Ask an appropriate question
  When I register on the site
  Then 
    * there should be 47 users
    or
    * there should be one more user
    or
    * I can log in

* Don't ask redundant questions
  * http://mocha.rubyforge.org/examples/mocha.html
  * line(5) == "warp_factor.times { @dilithium.nuke(:anti_matter) }"

* Write what you want to say (your tests are your docs)

* Trust
* How much do you trust the code?
* Trust other tests

* stick to the level
* don't ask low level questions during a high level test
* don't ask high level questions during a low level test

## So many opinions

* no one knows
* what is the most cost-effective?
* the most productive
* If we knew, this would have been very boring

## Questions

* That was a statement
* Testing is about asking questions
* Learn to ask the right questions
* Questions? (Seriously)
